# Line Following Robot (LFR)


## Introduction

Welcome to the Line Following Robot (LFR) project! This repository contains all the information and resources you need to build your own Line Following Robot. 

A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot that is designed to follow a path marked by a line on the ground. It's a fascinating project that combines electronics, robotics, and programming.

## Components

Before you get started, make sure you have the following components ready:

- **Arduino or Microcontroller**: You'll need a microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino nano or uno) to control the robot.

- **Infrared (IR) Sensors**: These sensors are used to detect the line on the ground.

- **Motors and Wheels**: To move the robot.

- **Motor Driver**: A motor driver is essential to control the speed and direction of the motors.

- **Chassis**: The physical structure of the bot.

- **Battery/Power Supply**: To provide power to the robot.

- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For connecting the components.

Above is the circuit diagram for the Line Following Robot. It shows how all the components are connected. Make sure to follow this diagram when building your robot.

## Working

### Working of LFR

The Line Following Robot works based on the principle of IR sensor feedback. The IR sensors are placed on the bottom of the robot and are used to detect the contrast between the line and the background. Here's how it works:

1. The IR sensors constantly measure the amount of reflected infrared light.

2. When the sensor is over the line, it detects more reflected light due to the contrast, and when it's off the line, it detects less.

3. The microcontroller processes the sensor data and determines which direction the robot should move to stay on the line.

### How to Control Motors According to IR

- To make the robot follow the line, you need to program the microcontroller to adjust the motor speeds based on the IR sensor readings.

- For example, if the left sensor detects more IR reflection (over the line), you might need to increase the speed of the right motor to steer the robot back on track.

- Experiment with different thresholds and motor control strategies to fine-tune the robot's performance.

## Uploading the Code

You can find the Arduino code for this project in the `code` directory of this repository. Upload the code to your microcontroller to make the robot operate according to the IR sensor readings.

## Application in the Real World

Line Following Robots have practical applications in various industries:

- **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**: These robots are used in factories and warehouses to transport goods efficiently.

- **Agriculture**: Line Following Robots can be used for crop monitoring and management.

- **Search and Rescue**: LFRs can be employed in disaster-stricken areas for search and rescue operations.

- **Education**: They are excellent tools for teaching robotics and programming to students.
