# Line Following Robot (LFR)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Line Following Robot (LFR) project! This repository contains all the information and resources you need to build your own Line Following Robot. 

A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot that is designed to follow a path marked by a line on the ground. It's a fascinating project that combines electronics, robotics, and programming.

## Components

Before you get started, make sure you have the following components ready:

- **Arduino or Microcontroller**: You'll need a microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino) to control the robot.

- **Infrared (IR) Sensors**: These sensors are used to detect the line on the ground.

- **Motors and Wheels**: To move the robot.

- **Motor Driver**: A motor driver is essential to control the speed and direction of the motors.

- **Chassis**: The physical structure of the robot.

- **Battery/Power Supply**: To provide power to the robot.

- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For connecting the components.

Above is the circuit diagram for the Line Following Robot. It shows how all the components are connected. Make sure to follow this diagram when building your robot.

## Working

### Working of LFR

The Line Following Robot operates using a binary control system. The IR sensors are placed on the bottom of the robot and are used to detect the contrast between the line and the background. Here's how it works:

1. The IR sensors constantly measure the amount of reflected infrared light.

2. When the sensor is over the line, it detects more reflected light due to the contrast, and when it's off the line, it detects less.

3. Based on the sensor readings, the robot's microcontroller controls the motors. It can be a simple high or low control system.

   - If the left sensor detects more IR reflection (over the line), the left motor may be set to high, and the right motor to low to steer the robot back on track.
   - If the right sensor detects more IR reflection, the right motor may be set to high, and the left motor to low.

## Uploading the Code

You can find the Arduino code for this project in the `code` directory of this repository. Upload the code to your microcontroller to implement the binary control system that operates the motors according to the IR sensor readings.

## Application in the Real World

Line Following Robots have practical applications in various industries:

- **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**: These robots are used in factories and warehouses to transport goods efficiently.

- **Agriculture**: Line Following Robots can be used for crop monitoring and management.

- **Search and Rescue**: LFRs can be employed in disaster-stricken areas for search and rescue operations.

- **Education**: They are excellent tools for teaching robotics and programming to students.
